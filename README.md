# React-Flashcard-App
I remade my Vanilla JavaScript App, but this time in React

What I learned

I have been reading Learning React: Functional Web Development with React and Redux Book by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello. 
I decided to apply the knowledge I have gained from the first half of the book to rewrite a web application I made with Vanilla JavaScipt.
I learned how to manage state, use props, when to use functional stateless components vs class components, 
as well as simply becoming comformatable with developing in the React JS enviroment. 
Just like my previous version I have supplied Chinese words as flashcard data.
